## üîçüìñ Annotated Puzzle Statement

> It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:
> 
> - forward X increases the horizontal position by X units.
> - down X increases the depth by X units.
> - up X decreases the depth by X units.
> 
> After following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 10. (Multiplying these together produces 150.)
> 
> Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

## üíæüîç Content Decoding

Opening the input contents file, we notice that each line starts with command followed by a quantity.

First, let's confirm this assumption:

```python
for line in open('./advent-of-code/2021/day-2/input.txt').readlines():
    assert len(line.split()) == 2 \
        and line.split()[0] in ['forward', 'up', 'down'] \
        and line.split()[1].isdigit()
```

Which is does great! We can move and create a proper method this time. Before creating said method, we must agree on a return type. 

Looking at the input contents files, we have a number of lines with no relationship between them. An [iterator](py-iterator) is a good fit for such scenarios promoting sequential processing. This means that the method uses a `yield` statement instead of `return`.

The structure of each line is a string followed by an integer. Thus, the return object is `Iterator[tuple]`

```python
def load_contents(filename: Path) -> Iterator[tuple]:
    """Load and convert contents from file

    :param filename: input filename
    :return: iterator
    """
    for line in open(filename).readlines():
        items = line.split()
        yield items[0], int(items[1])
    log.debug(f'Reached end of {filename=}')
```
