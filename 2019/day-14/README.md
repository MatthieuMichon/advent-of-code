## 🔍📖 Annotated Puzzle Statement

> As you approach the rings of Saturn, your ship's low fuel indicator turns on. There isn't any fuel here, but the rings have plenty of raw material. Perhaps your ship's Inter-Stellar Refinery Union brand nanofactory can turn these raw materials into fuel.
> 
> You ask the nanofactory to produce a list of the reactions it can perform that are relevant to this process (your puzzle input). Every reaction turns some quantities of specific input chemicals into some quantity of an output chemical.

The **puzzle input** is a **list** of *reactions*, with a **reaction** being a pair of a list of chemicals and single chemical.

```
chemical: string
reaction: tuple(tuple(chemical), chemical)
puzzle_input: tuple(reactions)
```

> Almost every chemical is produced by exactly one reaction; the only exception, `ORE`, is the raw material input to the entire process and is not produced by a reaction.
> 
> You just need to know how much `ORE` you'll need to collect before you can produce one unit of `FUEL`.

> Each reaction gives specific quantities for its inputs and output; reactions cannot be partially run, so only whole integer multiples of these quantities can be used. **(It's okay to have leftover chemicals when you're done, though.)**
> 
> For example, the reaction:
> ```
> 1 A, 2 B, 3 C => 2 D
> ```
> means that exactly `2` units of chemical `D` can be produced by consuming exactly `1 A`, `2 B` and `3 C`. You can run the full reaction as many times as necessary; for example, you could produce `10 D` by consuming `5 A`, `10 B`, and `15 C`.

This explanation is well done.

> Suppose your nanofactory produces the following list of reactions:
> ```
> 10 ORE => 10 A
> 1 ORE => 1 B
> 7 A, 1 B => 1 C
> 7 A, 1 C => 1 D
> 7 A, 1 D => 1 E
> 7 A, 1 E => 1 FUEL
> ```

Parsing the input contents should also be easy.

> The first two reactions use only ORE as inputs; they indicate that you can produce as much of chemical A as you want (in increments of 10 units, each 10 costing 10 ORE) and as much of chemical B as you want (each costing 1 ORE). To produce 1 FUEL, a total of 31 ORE is required: 1 ORE to produce 1 B, then 30 more ORE to produce the 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 A (with 2 extra A wasted) required in the reactions to convert the B into C, C into D, D into E, and finally E into FUEL. (30 A is produced because its reaction requires that it is created in increments of 10.)

Or, suppose you have the following list of reactions:

9 ORE => 2 A
8 ORE => 3 B
7 ORE => 5 C
3 A, 4 B => 1 AB
5 B, 7 C => 1 BC
4 C, 1 A => 1 CA
2 AB, 3 BC, 4 CA => 1 FUEL

The above list of reactions requires 165 ORE to produce 1 FUEL:

    Consume 45 ORE to produce 10 A.
    Consume 64 ORE to produce 24 B.
    Consume 56 ORE to produce 40 C.
    Consume 6 A, 8 B to produce 2 AB.
    Consume 15 B, 21 C to produce 3 BC.
    Consume 16 C, 4 A to produce 4 CA.
    Consume 2 AB, 3 BC, 4 CA to produce 1 FUEL.

Here are some larger examples:

    13312 ORE for 1 FUEL:

    157 ORE => 5 NZVS
    165 ORE => 6 DCFZ
    44 XJWVT, 5 KHKGT, 1 QDVJ, 29 NZVS, 9 GPVTF, 48 HKGWZ => 1 FUEL
    12 HKGWZ, 1 GPVTF, 8 PSHF => 9 QDVJ
    179 ORE => 7 PSHF
    177 ORE => 5 HKGWZ
    7 DCFZ, 7 PSHF => 2 XJWVT
    165 ORE => 2 GPVTF
    3 DCFZ, 7 NZVS, 5 HKGWZ, 10 PSHF => 8 KHKGT

    180697 ORE for 1 FUEL:

    2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 11 MNCFX => 1 STKFG
    17 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL
    53 STKFG, 6 MNCFX, 46 VJHF, 81 HVMC, 68 CXFTF, 25 GNMV => 1 FUEL
    22 VJHF, 37 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM
    139 ORE => 4 NVRVD
    144 ORE => 7 JNWZP
    5 MNCFX, 7 RFSQX, 2 FWMGM, 2 VPVL, 19 CXFTF => 3 HVMC
    5 VJHF, 7 MNCFX, 9 VPVL, 37 CXFTF => 6 GNMV
    145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
    1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
    1 VJHF, 6 MNCFX => 4 RFSQX
    176 ORE => 6 VJHF

    2210736 ORE for 1 FUEL:

    171 ORE => 8 CNZTR
    7 ZLQW, 3 BMBT, 9 XCVML, 26 XMNCP, 1 WPTQ, 2 MZWV, 1 RJRHP => 4 PLWSL
    114 ORE => 4 BHXH
    14 VRPVC => 6 BMBT
    6 BHXH, 18 KTJDG, 12 WPTQ, 7 PLWSL, 31 FHTLT, 37 ZDVW => 1 FUEL
    6 WPTQ, 2 BMBT, 8 ZLQW, 18 KTJDG, 1 XMNCP, 6 MZWV, 1 RJRHP => 6 FHTLT
    15 XDBXC, 2 LTCX, 1 VRPVC => 6 ZLQW
    13 WPTQ, 10 LTCX, 3 RJRHP, 14 XMNCP, 2 MZWV, 1 ZLQW => 1 ZDVW
    5 BMBT => 4 WPTQ
    189 ORE => 9 KTJDG
    1 MZWV, 17 XDBXC, 3 XCVML => 2 XMNCP
    12 VRPVC, 27 CNZTR => 2 XDBXC
    15 KTJDG, 12 BHXH => 5 XCVML
    3 BHXH, 2 VRPVC => 7 MZWV
    121 ORE => 7 VRPVC
    7 XCVML => 6 RJRHP
    5 BHXH, 4 VRPVC => 5 LTCX

Given the list of reactions in your puzzle input, what is the minimum amount of ORE required to produce exactly 1 FUEL?
