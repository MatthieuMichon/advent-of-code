## Notable Puzzles

### Day 10: Adapter Array

Stuck on part two, had to refer to the subreddit megathread.

I decided that relying on a forward walking with a back-track was the best way forward.

### Day 19: Monster Messages

Stuck: had to hard-code top of rule dependency graph 

### Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw

Stuck: had to use recursion for reconstructing the image

### Day 23: Crab Cups

Stuck: had to use a list for storing clockwise object
