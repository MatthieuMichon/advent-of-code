[Day 16](./day-16) | [Ticket Translation](./day-16/README.md) | Ok | First try was naive, hopefully field constraints where not sneaky. 
[Day 17](./day-17) | [Conway Cubes](./day-17/README.md) | Ok | Ok
[Day 18](./day-18) | [Operation Order](./day-18/README.md) | Interesting! used the shunting-yard algorithm and RPN evaluation | Ok
[Day 19](./day-19) | [Monster Messages](./day-19/README.md) | Interesting! used a top-down graph traversal | Stuck: had to hard-code top of rule dependency graph 
[Day 20](./day-20) | [Jurassic Jigsaw](./day-20/README.md) | Ok | Stuck: had to use recursion for reconstructing the image

[Day 22](./day-22) | [Crab Combat](./day-22/README.md) | Ok | Ok, lost some time reading too fast (applied max sort which isn't always the case in the second part)
[Day 23](./day-23) | [Crab Cups](./day-23/README.md) | Ok | Stuck: had to use a list for storing clockwise object
[Day 24](./day-24) | [Lobby Layout](./day-24/README.md) | First try was too naive | Ok but long runtime (several minutes)
[Day 25](./day-25) | [Combo Breaker](./day-25/README.md) | Ok, required several performance improvement rounds | -
